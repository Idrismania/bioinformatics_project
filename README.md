# U-Net model implementation
As of 27-10-2023, this is placeholder code for my future generated mask data. For now, I use publicly available data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/newra008/lung-mask-image-dataset

To replicate project, download the dataset and create a data folder in the root directory. Move train/ test/ and val/ folders to your created data folder.
